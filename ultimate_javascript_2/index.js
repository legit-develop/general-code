//functional programming
//Isolated functions = there are no dependance on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
//Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
//functions with limited side effects - any changes or mutation to the state of the program outside of the function are carefully controlled.

//Functional Programming Terminology
// Callbacks are function that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function
// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like normal value are called first class functions
// All Javascript functions are first class function
// The function that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions
// When functions are passed into or returned from another function, than those functions which were passed in or returned can be called lambda
